# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was an introduction to tech-tests using React. It built upon concepts we had covered in the weather-app.

## Commands you can run:

In the terminal of the project directory, run:

### `npm test`

This will run all the tests and ensure they're in working order.

### `npm start`

This will fire up the app and allow you to interact with it in a web browser.
